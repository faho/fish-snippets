Some neat fish snippets and tricks

I recommend not using this as-is. Look at the things here and pick anything you're interested in.

# What's here

- A port of [pridecat](https://github.com/lunasorcery/pridecat) to pure builtins-only fish script - pipe into it to have your output colored in pride flag colors
- "goblin-mode" - this is basically a prank. It will, after every command:
  - Randomize fish's syntax highlighting colors
  - Choose a random prompt from fish's presets
  - Print a random fortune (if it finds the fortune database)
